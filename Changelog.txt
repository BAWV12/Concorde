     2.15	   April 2017		      After cold start nose wheel steering didn't work, there was a logical error in the file Concorde-hydraulic.nas
					      Fixed bad working G meter
					      Changed maximum frequency of ADF receivers to 500 kHz
					      Removed ceiling hardcap at 109k feets, now with slow climb is maximum altitude around 70k feets without lost of speed, with zoom climb can do 80k feets for short time, then stall and go down
					      Bug in the fuel management - when turn on pumps on tank 9 or 11 and open inlet valves for that tanks, fuel amount rise until tanks are full, there was a logical error in the NASAL code for fuel management
					      Fixed engine overheat red light on engineer's panel, light go to red when exhaust gas temperature is over 840 deg C
					      MACH cone added, used particle system
					      Added vapor over the wings in high AoA based on the work of Fabrizio Fracaroli (F-22).
					      Added Save Concorde Group livery for G-BOAE if RTF project will be successull :)
					      Added wingtips vortexes
					      New dynamic contrails - size based on throttles, no contrails, when engine flame out (bugfix)
					      Fixed T/O monitor, now when armed, N2 can go over 100%, when inhibited, only 100% N2 allowed
					      Modified smoke, base engine smoke unmodified, but added more smoke with reheaters engaged
					      Added N1 autoreduce function - when speed is over 2 M, autoreducer will automaticaly lower N1 to prevent overspeed and dramatic overheat aircraft's nose (TMO shouldn't rise over 127 degree C)
					      Fixed nozzle bucket animation, they was overlaped for reversers
					      Fixed ATIS, now You can hear spoken information
					      INS waypoints increased from 9 to 99
					      Brake overheat warning light fixed, now works correctly
					      Cockpit remap and retexture
