<!-- Concorde 3D panel : autopilot right side, avoiding automatic clipping because too large.

Organized like the real one at http://www.concordesst.com/.
See also pictures at http://www.airliners.net/info/.

ALIGNMENT :
- position of autopilot buttons seems independent of Concorde version.
- but their alignment with the instruments of Captain/Center/Copilot is more or less to the left or right.
- the choiced alignment has the most buttons visible by the Captain (left).
- reference is http://www.airliners.net/open.file/373509/L/ (Air France F-BVFB, Markus Mosshamer).

WARNING : a button not working by click, means that it is too close of another button (eventually hidden);
even if both click areas (ctrl-C) don't overlap. Changing internal geometry of button avoids this drawback.

_______________________________________________________________________

This is a panel configuration file for the open-source flight
simulator FlightGear (www.flightgear.org).  The file is an XML-encoded
FlightGear property list defining the panel's background texture and
the location (and optionally, size) of the instruments that will
appear on the panel.

Each instrument is, itself, defined in an XML-encoded property list
in a separate file.

Co-ordinates are relative to the *bottom* left corner of the screen
(as in OpenGL).  The total FlightGear window is always considered to
be 1024x768, whatever its actual display size on the screen.  All
paths are relative to $FG_ROOT.

Note that the name of the element defining each instrument must be
different, or else instrument definitions will be overwritten:
that's not particularly XML-ish, but that's how property lists
work in FlightGear right now.

Each instrument has its own preferred width and height, but you can
override those by providing <w>..</w> and <h>..</h> properties with the
<x>...</x> and <y>...</y> properties.

     MH  IH     | IN  TH  |  HH  TU  PH  |  MP  CL  IP  AH
         IA     | BB  VL  |      GA  LA  |  GL  CR  VS  AA
     AT1 AT2 SS | FD1 HT1      VR1  AP1 AP2 HT2    VR2  FD2 AS

MH : Mach Hold (current)
AT : Autothrottle; default to IH.
IH : Indicated Air Speed Hold (current); default when autothrottle enabled.
IA : Indicated Air Speed Acquire (dial).
SS : Speed Select.
IN : Inertial Navigation System mode : track between 2 points beeing fed from the INS.
BB : Back Beam is a flight director mode, not an autopilot mode. It will only operate with autopilot disengaged, and
     permits tracking of a back beam localizer.
FD : Flight Director.
TH : Track or Heading (dial) : heading mode follows the compass direction, while track mode will follow the direct route,
     taking into account wind speeds.
VL : VOR 1 or Localiser lock.
HT : Heading or Track.
HH : Heading Hold (current); default when autopilot engaged.
TU : Turbulence mode, only used in moderate to severe turbulence. It holds the existing pitch and heading, and reduces
     the trim rate to smoothen the ride.
GA : An automatic go around is initiated when 2 throttles have been moved forward in autoland or glide mode.
     Holds pitch at 15 deg.
VR : VOR loc or Ref.
PH : Pitch Hold; default when autopilot engaged.
LA : Autoland : glide slope 1 + Nav 1 Loc
AP : Autopilot; default to HH and PH.
MP : Mach Hold (current), with pitch. If the autothrottle is engaged, it will take precedence, and the autopilot will
     default to Pitch Hold.
GL : Glide : glide slope 1 + Nav 1 Lock
CL : max CLimb sets speed at Vmo; once reached, holds it with pitch.  
CR : max CRuise engaged shortly after Mach 2, is an extension of Max Climb. If the aircraft begins to overspeed due to
     temperature changes, the autothrottle will slow the aircraft down. Once at the correct speed, Mach Hold will
     disengage, and Max Cruise will re-engage. It also prevents the aircraft exceeding the maximum operating temperature
     (TMO) of 127 deg Celsius on the tip of the nose. 
IP : Indicated Air Speed Hold (current), with pitch
VS : Vertical Speed Hold.
AH : Altitude Hold (current)
AA : Altitude Acquire (dial)
AS : Altitude Select.

BB is not implemented.


Acquired modes have a light.
During the capture, a triangle lights below VO, LA, GL and AA, until the acquisition.
